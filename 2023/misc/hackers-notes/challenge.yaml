name: a hacker's notes
author: burturt
description: |-
  We managed to get ahold of a flash drive which we think contains the decryption keys for the ransomware that a hacker group tried to deploy on our computer network! However, it seems like the hacker encrypted the flash drive. We know that the organization uses passwords in the format hacker### (hacker + 3 digits) for their disks, but a much stronger encryption password once you login. Can you try to get access to their notes?
