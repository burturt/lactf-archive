  I was trying to send a flag to my friend over UDP, one character at a time, but it got corrupted! I think someone else was messing around with me and sent extra bytes, though it seems like they actually abided by RFC 3514 for once. Can you get the flag?

flag: "lactf{3V1L_817_3xf1l7R4710N_4_7H3_W1N_51D43c8000034d0c}"

provide:
- 'EBE.pcap'
