  I heard C was insecure so I wrote my flag redactor program in C++.

  `{{nc}}`

  Note: There are multiple optimized implementations of `memmove` and one is selected at runtime based on available CPU features, meaning that any solution that uses the `memmove` GOT entry could fail on remote. The challenge is solvable without `memmove`.

flag:
  file: ./flag.txt

provide:
  - ./redact
  - ./redact.cpp
  - ./Dockerfile

containers:
  main:
    build: .
    replicas: 1
    ports:
      - 5000
    securityContext:
      privileged: true

expose:
  main:
    - target: 5000
      tcp: 31281
