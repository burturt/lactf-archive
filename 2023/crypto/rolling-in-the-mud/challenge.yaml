    uugh, these pigs in my pen are making a complete mess! They're *rolling* all over the place!

    Anyway, can you decode this cipher they gave me, almost throwing it at me while rolling around?

    Answer in lowercase with symbols. In the image, { and } are characters that should appear in your flag, and replace spaces with `_`.

flag: "lactf{rolling_and_rolling_and_rolling_until_the_pigs_go_home}"

provide:
  - ./cipher.png
