# lactf-challenges-2023
Challenges for LA CTF 2023.
## Organization (PLEASE READ FIRST)
- `/CATEGORY/CHALLENGENAME/stuff`, where stuff includes a [challenge.yml](https://rcds.redpwn.net/en/latest/challenge/) ([sample](https://rcds.redpwn.net/en/latest/config-samples/#multi-container-web-challenge))
- e.g. `/web/blog_haxxor/FILES_HERE`
- Feel free to dump challenge files and content into a new challenge folder first before formalizing it with a challenge.yml
- Writeups ideally are in markdown for ease of viewing in github GUI. Highly recommend at least a super basic one so that should something go wrong during the ctf, other organizers can provide support
